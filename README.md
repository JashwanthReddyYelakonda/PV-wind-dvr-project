# Fuzzy-Based Voltage Sag Enhancement in a Grid-Connected Hybrid PV-Wind System

This project presents a **MATLAB/Simulink-based simulation** of a **grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system** that uses a **fuzzy logic-controlled DVR (Dynamic Voltage Restorer)** to enhance voltage stability during sags.

---

## Objective

To design and simulate a hybrid **PV-Wind energy system** integrated with a **battery** and **Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES)** unit, and apply a **Fuzzy Logic Controller** to control the DVR for effective voltage sag compensation.

---

## Key Components

- **Hybrid PV-Wind Power Source**
- **Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR)**
- **Battery + SMES Storage**
- **Fuzzy Logic Controller** (using MATLAB FIS Toolbox)
- **MATLAB/Simulink simulation**

## Tools Used

- **MATLAB Simulink**
- **Fuzzy Logic Toolbox**

---

## Features & Highlights

- Simulates **voltage sags** under different loading and fault conditions.
- Demonstrates the use of **soft computing (Fuzzy Logic)** in real-time power system control.
- Supports both **grid-connected** and **islanded** microgrid modes.

---

## Future Scope

- Extend fuzzy controller to include **neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS)** for adaptive control.
- Add real hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) validation using microcontrollers.
- Include **MPPT** for PV optimization.
